# Motherbrain Full Stack Challenge

Hello! :wave:

To begin the challenge, you have to have [Docker](https://docker.com) installed.
You'll also need a copy of the secret `.env` file, saved to the root of this project.

Please fork this repo.

Next, run `docker-compose up` in this project and go to
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) when everything is built and ready.
There you'll find more information.

Good Luck!
